System Design is defined as a process of creating an architecture for different components, interfaces, and modules of the system and providing corresponding data helpful in implementing such elements in systems.

What is Systems Design. Definition: Systems design is the process of defining elements of a system like modules, architecture, components and their interfaces and data for a system based on the specified requirements
System Design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements.
Software design is a mechanism to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation.

Scalability in System Design.
Scalability, in simple terms, means your appâ€™s ability to handle more and more users or data without breaking 

Horizontal scaling , Vertical Scaling 
horizontal scaling refers to adding additional nodes, 
vertical scaling describes adding more power to your current machines (Single big machine).
